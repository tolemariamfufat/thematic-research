Introduction


Afaan Oromoo is one of a widely spoken indigenous language in Africa (Mekuria, 1997: 326). This indigenous language is a lingua franca in many parts of 
Ethiopia, southern half of Ethiopia in particular. Although it is an important language of wider communication in Ethiopia, Afaan Oromoo has’t been 
given a chance to develop until very recently (Mekuria, 1997: 326). Since the fall of the Derg regime in 1991, prohibition on the use of Afaan Oromoo
has been legally removed. Afaan Oromoo has got its official recognition altogether with other languages of Ethiopian nations and nationalities. 
Consequently, Afaan Oromoo has become a fast growing language in Ethiopia. It has become the official working language of Oromiya Regional State. 
Afaan Oromoo has been promoted to language of mass media and medium of instruction from grade 1-8. Afaan Oromoo is taught as a subject in high schools. 
This indigenous language is a medium of instruction and given as a field of study in Teacher’s Training Colleges in 
Oromiya Regional State (Disasa, 2013: 3080). Teaching Afaan Oromoo in Ethiopian Higher Education has started. 
Currently, Afaan Oromoo is offered as a field of study for BA, MA and PhD level at different universities of Ethiopia.
Afaan Oromoo is studied as academic discipline in many Ethiopian government universities; namely Addis Ababa University, Jimma University, 
Haromaya University, Adama Universitiy, Wallaga University, Dilla University, Mettu University, etc (Disasa, 2013: 3080). 


Rationale

MoE has recently prepared a four year program of nationally harmonized higher education curriculum for bachelor of arts degree in Afaan Oromoo, 
Literature and Communication as a substitution of the three year BA program of harmonized curriculum to be offered in different universities offering 
the program in Afaan Oromoo. The nationally revised and harmonized curriculum is geared to towards producing competent Afaan Oromoo graduates that can meet 
current market needs of the people, the Oromo in particular.  Because of this case students stay for a period of four years in the universities. 
Moreover, many new courses are added and old courses are upgraded.  

In spite of the fact that different universities teach students different courses on the basis of the nationally harmonized higher education curriculum
for BA in Afaan Oromoo, they haven't any standard terminologies to teach different courses. Consequently, different universities teach the same course 
using different terminologies. More worse, different instructors who teach the same course in the same university do not have a standard terminology. 




The absence of a standard nationally harmonized terminology for a nationally harmonized higher education curriculum for bachelor of arts degree in Afaan
Oromoo hinders the production of well-quliffied Afaan Oromoo professionals who can contribute to the development of the country, eduction sector 
in particular. This thematic research fills this gap by preparing a nationally standardized terminologies for a nationally harmonized higher education
curriculum for BA in Afaan Oromoo.
